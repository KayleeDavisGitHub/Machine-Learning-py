# Machine Learning in Python
My hope with this repository is to upload progress on neural network training and other machine learning training in Python. 

Classification data has been included here, provided by UC Irvine:

Python code is using the latest version of Python (3.6 on 10/13/2017) via Anaconda (Spyder):

Code runs through K nearest neighbors, classification using data, and SVMs.

And then classifying and coloring in points!
