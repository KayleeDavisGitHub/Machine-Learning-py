# Machine Learning in Python
My hope with this repository is to upload progress on neural network training in Python. 

Classification data has been included here, provided by UC Irvine:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/

Python code is using the latest version of Python (3.6 on 10/13/2017) via Anaconda (Spyder):
https://www.anaconda.com/download/

Code runs through K nearest neighbors, classification using data, and SVMs.

# Example: KNN Visalizations In Python's 'fivethirtyeight'
Considering a new datum added with supervised learning:

And then classifying and coloring in points!
